# Javascript learning via [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)

What I learned:

- Fundamentals: variables, if/else, operators, boolean logic, functions, arrays, objects, loops, strings, etc.

- Modern OOP: Classes, constructors, prototypal inheritance, encapsulation, etc.

- Asynchronous JavaScript: Event loop, promises, async/await, AJAX calls and APIs

- Tooling like NPM, Parcel, Babel and ES6 modules

- Modern ES6+ uses like : arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator.

- How JavaScript really works behind the scenes.
